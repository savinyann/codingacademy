                <p>You will upgrade your search possibilities. It should now be possible to search by a word or a part of word contained in the elements.</p>
                <p>For example if I search for “rick” and I have an email “patrick@something.com” and a “todo” with the value “Send a mail to Rick”, they both must be displayed.</p>
                <p>Moreover, you should add the possibility to combine your search with words and types, so in the previous example if I also choose to display only “todo” only the “Send a mail to Rick” should be displayed in the end.</p>
                <p>Once again, there should be no element destroyed, and it should be possible to switch from a search to another without the need to reset everything. (For example if I selected “todo” and “rick” in my search but now decided I want all the types I should not need to erase everything and re-do my selection).</p>
